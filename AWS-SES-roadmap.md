# AWS SES Integration Roadmap for Fire Risk Dashboard

This document outlines the plan for integrating AWS Simple Email Service (SES) with the Sierra City Fire Risk Dashboard to enable both event-triggered alerts and scheduled report distribution based on real-time weather data and fire risk assessments.

---

## 1. AWS SES Account Setup and Configuration

- **Create/Access AWS Account:**
  - Sign up or log in to your AWS account.
  - Create IAM users with appropriate SES permissions.
  
- **SES Configuration:**
  - Verify your sender email address (e.g., alerts@sierracityfire.org).
  - Verify your domain for improved deliverability and professional appearance.
  - Request production access to move out of the SES sandbox environment.

- **Email Authentication Setup:**
  - Configure DKIM, SPF, and DMARC records for your domain.
  - Create dedicated sending identities for different notification types (alerts vs. reports).

- **Credentials Management:**
  - Store AWS credentials securely using environment variables on Render.
  - Implement credential rotation practices following AWS best practices.

## 2. Notification Types and Content Design

- **Risk-Level Change Alerts:**
  - Design email templates for risk level transitions (Green→Yellow, Yellow→Red, etc.).
  - Include current weather parameters that triggered the change.
  
- **Daily Risk Summary Reports:**
  - Create a template showing 24-hour trends of temperature, humidity, wind speed, and soil moisture.
  - Include screenshot of the current dashboard status.
  
- **System Status Notifications:**
  - Design templates for technical notifications (API failures, extended cache usage, etc.).
  - Target these emails to system administrators rather than general subscribers.

- **Template Development:**
  - Use responsive HTML templates with fallback plain text versions.
  - Incorporate your existing fire risk color coding and branding.
  - Design templates to display properly on mobile devices.

---

## 3. Integration with Fire Risk Dashboard Backend

- **Event-Based Triggers:**
  - Modify `fire_risk_logic.py` to detect meaningful changes in risk levels.
  - Create hooks in `cache_refresh.py` to trigger emails when data is significantly updated.
  - Implement logic to prevent notification flooding during rapidly changing conditions.

- **Dashboard Screenshot Automation:**
  - Implement headless browser automation (Selenium or Puppeteer) to capture dashboard state.
  - Store screenshots temporarily in memory or S3 before email attachment.
  - Include timestamps and condition indicators in the screenshot.

- **Cache-Aware Notifications:**
  - Include data freshness indicators in emails when using cached data.
  - Add special notifications for extended periods of cached-only operation.

- **Email Sending Module:**
  - Create a new module `email_service.py` to handle all SES interactions.
  - Implement boto3-based functions for sending different types of emails.
  - Add robust error handling and retry logic.

---

## 4. Subscriber Management System

- **Database Schema:**
  - Design a schema for storing subscriber information (email, name, preferences).
  - Include subscription status, preference settings, and audit fields.
  - Consider using DynamoDB or similar AWS service for tight integration.

- **Subscription Management UI:**
  - Create simple web forms for subscription sign-up and management.
  - Implement preference controls (alert types, frequency, thresholds).
  - Design mobile-friendly interfaces for community access.

- **API Endpoints:**
  - Add new endpoints in `endpoints.py` for subscription management.
  - Implement secure token-based unsubscribe links.
  - Create admin endpoints for subscription list management.

- **Compliance Features:**
  - Implement double opt-in flows with confirmation emails.
  - Add unsubscribe links to all emails and honor opt-out requests immediately.
  - Store consent records and timestamps.

---

## 5. Scheduling and Automation

- **Scheduled Reports:**
  - Configure daily report generation at 09:00 Pacific time.
  - Implement weekly summary options showing 7-day trends.

- **Conditional Triggers:**
  - Set up logic to trigger emails only when specific thresholds are crossed.
  - Allow subscribers to set their own notification thresholds.

- **Rate Limiting and Throttling:**
  - Implement controls to prevent excessive notifications during rapidly changing conditions.
  - Add cool-down periods between successive alerts of the same type.

- **Implementation Options:**
  - Use Render's scheduled jobs for time-based emails.
  - Implement internal scheduling for event-based notifications.
  - Consider AWS EventBridge for more complex scheduling needs.

---

## 6. Testing Strategy

- **Email Template Testing:**
  - Test templates across major email clients (Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail).
  - Verify mobile display of all templates.
  - Test with actual fire risk data from production or realistic test data.

- **Deliverability Testing:**
  - Use SES simulator addresses to test delivery without sending real emails.
  - Monitor initial sending reputation metrics closely.

- **Load Testing:**
  - Simulate high-volume sending scenarios to ensure system stability.
  - Test subscriber database performance with realistic data volumes.

- **End-to-End Testing:**
  - Create automated tests covering the complete notification workflow.
  - Test all subscription management functions.

---

## 7. Monitoring and Maintenance

- **SES Performance Metrics:**
  - Track delivery rates, opens, clicks, bounces, and complaints.
  - Set up CloudWatch alarms for bounce rate thresholds.

- **Logging System:**
  - Implement detailed logging for all email operations.
  - Record notification triggers, delivery attempts, and subscriber actions.

- **Reputation Management:**
  - Automatically remove bouncing addresses from your list.
  - Process and honor complaint feedback loops.
  - Regularly clean your subscriber list of inactive addresses.

- **Regular Audits:**
  - Schedule quarterly reviews of email performance.
  - Test all notification pathways during audits.

---

## 8. Security Considerations

- **Data Protection:**
  - Encrypt subscriber data at rest and in transit.
  - Implement appropriate access controls for subscriber information.
  - Consider GDPR and CCPA compliance requirements.

- **SES-Specific Security:**
  - Review AWS security best practices for SES.
  - Implement sending restrictions to prevent unauthorized use.
  - Consider dedicated IAM roles with minimum necessary permissions.

- **Secure Link Generation:**
  - Use signed URLs for unsubscribe and preference management links.
  - Implement expiration for security-sensitive links.

---

## 9. Deployment Plan

- **Phased Rollout:**
  - Begin with system administrator notifications only.
  - Gradually add official community stakeholders.
  - Finally open to public subscription.

- **Initial Deployment:**
  - Deploy with limited alert types to test system stability.
  - Monitor closely for any performance impacts on the main dashboard.

- **Production Monitoring:**
  - Implement enhanced logging during initial deployment.
  - Create a dashboard for email operation statistics.

---

## 10. Future Enhancements

- **SMS Integration:**
  - Consider adding text message alerts for critical conditions using AWS SNS.

- **Dynamic Content:**
  - Implement personalized content based on subscriber location or preferences.

- **API Extensions:**
  - Consider offering an API for third-party applications to access alert data.

- **Multi-channel Notification:**
  - Explore integration with other notification channels (mobile push, webhooks, etc.).
