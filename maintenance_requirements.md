| **Python Runtime** | Annually | Medium | Medium | Major Python version upgrades (e.g., 3.9 to 3.10) |
| **OS/Container Updates** | Quarterly | Medium | Low | Underlying OS or container image updates |

## 5. Security Components

| Component | Update Frequency | Priority | AI-Assisted Effort | Notes |
|-----------|------------------|---------|-------------------|-------|
| **Vulnerability Scanning** | Monthly | Critical | Minimal | Regular scanning for security issues |
| **Security Patches** | As needed | Critical | Low to Medium | Depends on severity and affected components |
| **Dependency Audit** | Monthly | High | Minimal | Review dependencies for known vulnerabilities |

## 6. Testing & Quality Assurance

| Component | Update Frequency | Priority | AI-Assisted Effort | Notes |
|-----------|------------------|---------|-------------------|-------|
| **Regression Testing** | After each update | High | Low | Ensure updates don't break functionality |
| **Test Suite Maintenance** | Quarterly | Medium | Low | Keep tests current with application changes |
| **Performance Testing** | Semi-annually | Medium | Low | Ensure application maintains performance standards |

## Effort Level Definitions

| AI-Assisted Effort | Description | Approximate Time |
|-------------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Minimal** | Quick prompts with minimal oversight | 5-15 minutes |
| **Low** | Some prompt engineering and verification | 15-30 minutes |
| **Medium** | Multiple prompts and testing | 30-60 minutes |
| **High** | Complex changes requiring iterative prompts and careful testing | 1-2 hours |

## Priority Level Definitions

| Priority | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Critical** | Must be addressed immediately (security or functionality issues) |
| **High** | Important for reliability and performance |
| **Medium** | Beneficial but not urgent |
| **Low** | Nice-to-have updates |

## Maintenance Strategy for AI-Assisted Development

1. **Utilize Automated Monitoring**:
   - Set up GitHub Dependabot or similar tools to automatically detect outdated dependencies
   - Use automated vulnerability scanners to identify security issues

2. **Implement a Quarterly Review Cycle**:
   - Use AI assistance to review and update dependencies
   - Focus on Critical and High priority items first
   - Batch similar updates together for efficiency

3. **Prompt Engineering for Maintenance**:
   - Develop effective prompts for common maintenance tasks
   - Document successful prompts for future reuse
   - Example: "Update all Python dependencies in requirements.txt to their latest compatible versions and test for any breaking changes"

4. **Simple Testing Strategy**:
   - Create basic test scripts that can be run after updates
   - Use AI to generate and update tests as needed
   - Manual verification of critical functionality

5. **Documentation**:
   - Keep a log of all updates performed
   - Document any issues encountered and their resolutions
   - Track API changes from external providers

This AI-assisted maintenance approach allows for effective upkeep of the application with minimal developer resources, leveraging AI capabilities to perform tasks that would traditionally require significant developer time.
