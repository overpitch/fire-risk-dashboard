## How to Use This Roadmap

This roadmap is designed to be a living document that guides the refactoring process. Each phase has clear objectives, tasks, and completion criteria. As we complete each phase, we'll update the "Current Status" section at the top of the document.

To work on the next phase, simply ask to "work on the next phase of the roadmap" or specify a particular phase you'd like to focus on. The roadmap is detailed enough that you don't need to provide additional context.

After each phase is completed, we'll update this roadmap to reflect the progress and any changes to the plan.
